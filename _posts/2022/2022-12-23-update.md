Two weeks ago I decided it was time to start a local Mastodon instance for Connecticut. I originally had an account on [mstdn.social](https://mstdn.social), and while [@stux](https://mstdn.social/@stux) is an incredible admin, Mastodon was starting to feel like just another big place on the web to get lost. I missed the feeling of the "old Internet" from the late 90s and early 2000s, logging onto small IRC servers or forums where community was measured in dozens or hundreds of members, not thousands or millions.

I had toyed with the idea of a local instance for a while, put up some polls to get input, networked with other regional instance admins, and did a lot of homework on what it would take to stand up my own instance, before finally pulling the trigger.

And what a busy two weeks it's been!

### Growth Charts

As a parent with a newborn at home, I'm a sucker for a good growth chart...

Growth has been slow but steady. In our first week we averaged one signup per day, hitting 8 by the 17th. We finally started to gain some momentum when nutmeg.social was listed on the official [Mastodon server directory](https://joinmastodon.org/servers)–we tripled our user count in less than a week.

### Donations

I will never charge for access to nutmeg.social, and I will never require donations. That said, running an instance gets [expensive](/finances/#current-funding), and some users started asking how they could contribute to server bills. I set up [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/tswan) and [PayPal](https://paypal.me/trevorswanson) pages to accept donations, and people delivered! In less than a week we've raised enough money to pay for about 2 months of server bills.

### Next Steps

There are a few things I anticipate nutmeg.social will need in the near future:

- **DMCA registration.** This will protect me (and nutmeg.social in the future) from liability if illegal content is uploaded to the instance. It costs $6 for a 3-year registration so the overall cost is low compared to the risk it mitigates.
- **Second server.** I provide more details below, but essentially getting a second server allows us to grow the instance. This will prevent issues when there's a lot of activity on the instance (e.g., big waves of Twitter migrations), provide space for more users, and prevent slowdowns like those we saw in the past week.

## The Nerdy Bits

### Infrastructure

We currently run Mastodon and all its components (Puma, the webserver; Sidekiq, the background job processor; Redis, an in-memory database where timelines, cache, and other data are stored, and; Postgres, the database holding all the persistent data for the instance) on a single VPS from OVHCloud, hosted in their US-East (Virginia) region. The server has 2 cores and 4GB of RAM which seems to be a commonly-recommended starting point for new instances. Based on some of the other instance admins I've talked to, it should sustain us to somewhere between 100-150 users before we have to grow.

Media for the instance (profile pictures and headers, images attached to posts, image previews for websites/links, etc) are hosted in S3 storage from Wasabi. I chose Wasabi because of its straightforward pricing – there is no egress billing (we don't have to pay every time someone loads an image), we just pay for how much we store. I'm also able to store encrypted server backups in a private S3 bucket to guarantee it's off-site and safe in case something happens to the server.

Media is reverse proxied through the main server to reduce the number of connections the end-user needs to make, and to allow for easier migration to a different provider in the future if needed.

I suspect our first scaling activity will be to separate the Postgres database onto its own instance. This will allow me to increase the number of Sidekiq queues, and up concurrency on the Puma web server, to grow the instance further.

### Monitoring Stack

I've set up Prometheus and a (private, for now) Grafana instance to track the health of the server overall, Postgres, Nginx, Mastodon services (Puma/Sidekiq), and Redis. An external [status page](https://status.nutmeg.social) from BetterStack monitors uptime and latency of our services (including the streaming API), as well as successful completion of backup cronjobs. BetterStack has graciously given me 5 free page-outs per month, which should be enough to cover unexpected outages on the platform.

In the future, I plan to set up Alertmanager to alert on other issues in the environment as well – and be able to stage a proactive response to incidents rather than hearing about an outage. This will let me get more in-depth alerting for specific behaviors or trends in the environment rather than simple up/down behavior.
