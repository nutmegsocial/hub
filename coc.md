# Code of Conduct
{:.no_toc}

This document lays out the ground rules for participating in the Nutmeg.social community. It is intended to protect all members of our community from harassment and to ensure that our community is as welcoming and inclusive as possible. This is a working document, so the [Nutmeg.social team](/team) may amend this CoC to better meet these goals in the future.

* TOC
{:toc}

## Goals

* Provide a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for everyone interested in Connecticut, regardless of gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, political affiliation, or other similar characteristic.
* Create a supportive community, where people freely share their passions and are excited and positive about each other's successes.
* Provide a venue for casual conversations — our instance is focused on Connecticut, but that doesn't mean that our conversations has to stop there.

## Non-Goals

While it's important to know what Nutmeg.social is, it's just as important to understand what we're not. Nutmeg.social is **not**:

* A free speech zone. Nutmeg.social is a community with specific — and high — standards of behaviour. If you would like to exercise your full free speech rights, you can do so **somewhere else**; while on Nutmeg.social, you should agree to follow the community rules set out in this CoC.

## Public vs non-Public Toots
### Public Toots

Public Toots are those that are posted to the public timelines. This means that anyone on Nutmeg.social can see your Toot on the local timeline and anyone on the Internet can see your Toot via the [see what's happening](https://nutmeg.social/public) page. This also means that your Toot will be visible to any instances that Nutmeg.social federates with, via the federated timeline.

### Non-Public Toots

At Nutmeg.social, we consider a non-public Toot to be Toots that are not posted to the public timelines. These include Toots that are posted with the following privacy settings:

* **Unlisted** - Not posted to public timelines, but viewable if someone visits your profile.
* **Follower-only** - Only viewable by a user who follows you.
* **Direct** - Only viewable to users who are @ mentioned in a Toot.

Users who follow you have consciously opted in to what you have to say. By using *Follower-only* you are talking direct to those people, and not the wider fediverse. People who follow you are more likely to understand the context and tone of what you're trying to say.

**Always use a Content Warning (CW) where appropriate, even for *Follower-only* and *Direct* Toots.**

## Rules for All Toots

All toots (public and private) should abide by the following rules:

* **Do not post any illegal content**, including sexual depictions of children, or any other content illegal in the United States (where nutmeg.social is hosted)
* **Do not use slurs or racist, sexist, genderist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory or hateful jokes or language** or promote white supremacy, anti-Semitism, transphobia or other hateful ideologies.
* **Do not harass anyone**, participate in group harassment of anyone, or otherwise engage in personal attacks. Posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information ("doxing") constitutes harassment.
* **Do not be intentionally antagonistic.** A post or reply designed to provoke a confrontation is not acceptable.
* **Do not post adult content without a content warning**, including pictures containing nudity, or unwelcome sexual attention (including sexualized comments or jokes).
* **Do not spread disinformation or conspiracy theories that undermine public health**. Healthy scientific debate is allowed but baseless, harmful conspiracies will not be tolerated.
* **Holocaust denial, Nazi symbolism, and promotion of National Socialism is strictly forbidden**.
* **Do not post spam**. Toots that are nothing other than a link and/or contain an inordinate number of hashtags constitute spam, as does any overly commercial self-promotion. (It is fine, however, to toot about your own projects and share what you are excited to be working on — just keep the toot itself interesting).
* **Do not use automated tools to toot without participating in the communit, without explicit permission from the [Nutmeg.social team](/team)**. It is fine to post with an automated tool (e.g., a Twitter cross-poster) so long as you are an active member of the Nutmeg.social community and respond to replies you receive here. However, unmonitored accounts that post automatically are not acceptable.

## Additional Rules for Public Toots

Public toots should follow the above rules and should also abide by the following additional rules:

* Do not engage in name calling, [ad hominem](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Ad%20hominem) attacks, or any other uncivil behaviour; criticize ideas, never people.
* **Do not tone police.** Other toots may violate the standards of civility we set on Nutmeg.social, but you should not criticize users for their tone. If the user is a member of the Nutmeg.social community, you should report them; if not, you should feel free to block them. In neither case should you criticize their tone.
* **Do not debate moderation actions in public toots.** If you disagree with how a moderator enforced this CoC you may direct-message the moderation team or email [hello@nutmeg.social](mailto:hello@nutmeg.social).

Always remember that your public toots are read not only by our *existing* community members (who may have the context to know what you mean) but by potential future community members as well. Strive to keep the local timeline representative of the inclusive, friendly community we want to build.

## Stalking, Doxxing, Harassment

Any conduct intended to stalk or harass other users, or to impede other users from utilizing the service, or to degrade the performance of the service, or to harass other users, or to incite other users to perform any of the aforementioned actions, is also disallowed, and subject to punishment up to and including revocation of access to the service. This includes, but is not limited to, the following behaviors:

* Continuing to engage in conversation with a user that has specifically has requested for said engagement with that user to cease and desist may be considered harassment, regardless of platform-specific privacy tools employed.
* Aggregating, posting, and/or disseminating a person's demographic, personal, or private data without express permission (informally called doxing or dropping dox) may be considered harassment.
* Inciting users to engage another user in continued interaction or discussion after a user has requested for said engagement with that user to cease and desist (informally called brigading or dogpiling) may be considered harassment.

## Reporting Violations

If you notice a toot that violates this code of conduct, *please* report it. It is easy to assume that someone else has already reported a toot, but it is easy for everyone to feel that way [and no one to report the toot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bystander_effect).

### Let the moderators moderate

If you see a toot that potentially contravenes this Code of Conduct, **do not** try to moderate, reprimand or enforce this CoC. That is the job of the moderation team.

Instead, please report the toot to the moderation team, who will take appropriate action.

## Catch-all

The moderation team will always take a pragmatic approach to every report they receive - if they feel that a problematic Toot isn't explicitly called out in this CoC, yet is inappropriate for Nutmeg.social, the Toot will likely be removed and the member will be dealt with appropriately.
