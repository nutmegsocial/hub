#### Why is my timeline so empty?
When you first join Mastodon, you are not following anyone. And unlike commercial/advertising-based social media, there are no algorithms forcing content on you! Check out the [local](https://nutmeg.social/public/local) and [federated](https://nutmeg.social/public/) timelines to find people to follow. **Note:** The official Mastodon app does not include a federated timeline. Check out alternatives like [tooot](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tooot/id1549772269) for iOS and [Tusky](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.keylesspalace.tusky) for Android.
If you are new, your Home timeline will be empty so check out the Local and Federated timelines to find people to follow which populates your Home timeline. There is no algorithm so you decide what shows up there. If you're on the official mobile apps you will need to switch to a 3rd party app to find the Local and Federated timelines. For iOS I recommend tooot and for Android I recommend Tusky.

#### What are the Home, Local, and Federated timelines?
There are three timelines in Mastodon: Home, Local, and Federated.

* **Home:** This timeline shows posts and boosts from the people you follow. You alone curate this feed by choosing to follow and unfollow people – there are no ads or sponsored content!
* **Local:** This timeline shows posts and boosts from people on your instance (e.g., other Nutmeggers). Think of this as the town square for our community.
* **Federated:** This timeline shows posts and boosts from everyone that your instance knows about across the Internet.

#### How do I search for things?

Search on the Fediverse is complicated, and the short answer is that the Mastodon search box is only set up to find people and hashtags.

However, many posts and profiles are indexed on Google–simply add "site:nutmeg.social" to the end of your search query to find things on our instance!

**Note:** If a user opted to prevent search engine indexing on their profile, their posts will *not* show up in Google search results.
