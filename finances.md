# Finances

Running a social network can be expensive, so [we accept donations in various forms](/support).

We want to be as transparent as possible when it comes to the support we receive from our members. You [support us](/support) every single day, so we want to let you know where your hard earned money is going.

## Current funding

*Last updated **January 6, 2023**.*

<label for="margin">Recurring donations/sponsorships currently cover about 18% of our monthly expenses.</label>
<progress id="margin" value="3.63" max="19.64"></progress>

We currently have **$137.56** in cash, and a monthly margin of **$-16.01**. This will support the instance for an estimated **8 months**.

## How funds are assigned

<aside markdown="1">

**<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-exclamation"></i> Funding shortages**

We are committed to building this community, and funding shortages will be supplemented out-of-pocket to keep the server afloat.

We subscribe to the [Mastodon Server Covenant](https://joinmastodon.org/covenant) and will provide at least 3 months of advance warning if this becomes unsustainable.

</aside>

When you [make a donation](/support), we do a couple of things:

1.  **Transfer the money into interest-bearing, FDIC-insured savings.**
2.  **Build and maintain a 6 month float of running expenses**, so we have funding in place should we need extra cash for things like an unexpected server upgrade.

If we greatly exceed our float, we will establish a process for patrons/members to vote on new features or improvements to the community, or for donations to important causes.
