# About Us

The whole point of Nutmeg.social is to be a community for people that are connected in some way to the state of Connecticut. Running a social network can be expensive, so [we accept donations in various forms](/support).

At Nutmeg.social, we want to be as transparent as possible when it comes to the support we receive from our members. You [support us](/support) every single day, so we want to let you know where your hard earned money is going.

## Funding Strategy

When you make a donation, either by [Ko-fi](https://kofi.com/tswan), [PayPal](https://paypal.me/trevorswanson), or other means, it eventually ends up in our PayPal account. With this funding we do a couple of things:

1.  We will strive to keep a 6 month float of running costs; so we know we have funding in place should we need extra cash for things like an unexpected server upgrade.
2.  If we greatly exceed our 6 month float, we will establish a process for patrons/members to vote on community donations (both to local Connecticut causes, as well as important online causes related to Mastodon, the Fediverse, and the like).

### Early days and funding shortages

Our [admin team](/team) is committed to building this community, and funding shortages will be supplemented out-of-pocket to keep the server afloat. We subscribe to the [Mastodon Server Covenant](https://joinmastodon.org/covenant) and will provide at least 3 months of advance warning if this becomes unsustainable.
