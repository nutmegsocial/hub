# Support Us

Running a social network can be expensive, so we accept donations in various forms:

{% include donate-buttons.html %}

If you can't contribute financially, that's okay â€“ nutmeg.social will always be free for all!

## Current funding

*Last updated **January 15, 2023**.*

<label for="margin">Recurring donations/sponsorships currently cover about 39% of our monthly expenses.</label>
<progress id="margin" value="7.78" max="19.70"></progress>

We currently have **$131.31** in cash, and a monthly margin of **$-11.92**. This will support the instance for an estimated **11 months**.

## How funds are assigned

<aside markdown="1">

**<i class="fa-solid fa-circle-exclamation"></i> Our promise to you**

We love our community and have no plans to hit the Off switch. However, if for some reason we decide to shutdown, we will stop taking contributions and use our funds to keep the service running as long as they allow (with a minimum of 3 months), giving everyone time to find a new home in the Fediverse.

</aside>

When you make a donation, we do a couple of things:

1.  **Transfer the money into interest-bearing, FDIC-insured savings.**
2.  **Build and maintain a 6 month float of running expenses**, so we have funding in place should we need extra cash for things like an unexpected server upgrade.

If we greatly exceed our float, we will establish a process for patrons/members to vote on new features or improvements to the community, or for donations to important causes.
